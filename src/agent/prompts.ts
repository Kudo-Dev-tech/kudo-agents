/**
 * Prompts live on disk as plain text, so an operational instruction is a file
 * in version control rather than a string buried in code.
 *
 * The system prompt is assembled from two files:
 *
 *   agents/_common.md          what every agent is told - the covenant model,
 *                              the honesty rules, how to work at the shell
 *   agents/<AGENT>/system.md   who this one is, and nothing else
 *
 * Splitting it that way is the point of the agents/ directory. Every CVM runs
 * the same image, pinned by the same digest, and `AGENT` is the only thing that
 * makes one of them Calder - so the rules cannot drift between agents, because
 * there is only one copy of them.
 *
 * Task prompts (prompts/<name>.txt) are shared for the same reason: what the
 * settler does each round should not depend on who is settling.
